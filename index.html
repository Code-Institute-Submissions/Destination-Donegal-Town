Donegal Town is the gateway to the Northwest. Donegal Town is the perfect location to explore the wonders of the Northwest. 
Ideally situated near the mouth of Donegal Bay, Donegal Town boasts a panoramic backdrop provided by the Blue Stack 
Mountains, a stately castle, a friendly population and an array of hotels and restaurants fit 
for every traveler and every taste. Donegal Town also boasts many clothing shops including world famous 
<a class="website-links" href="https://www.magee1866.com/" target="_blank">Magees of Donegal</a>
			and <a class="website-links" href="https://www.irishhouse.com/" target="_blank">The Irish House</a>
			which are well worth a visit. There is plenty to do in Donegal Town and I have highlighted the top four
			recommendations for places to stay, kids activities, family activities, nightlife and places to eat below.
			On the banks of the River Eske, Donegal town was a stamping
			ground of the O'Donnells, the great chieftains who ruled the northwest from the 15th to 17th
			centuries. Today, despite being the county's namesake, it's neither its largest town (the much
			larger Letterkenny), nor the county town (that's the even smaller town of Lifford).<br><br>

Donegal Town hosts a number of festivals throughout the year including the St Patricks Day Festival,
the Donegal Town Summer Festival and A Taste of Donegal Food Festival.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">All 
these festivals are for the young and old and there is something for everyone. Please see social
